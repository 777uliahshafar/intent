\section{Letter of Intent}

Architecture has been a major influence in my life.
I have studied it maybe almost a decade since I was in a vocational high school until now.
In the beginning to the middle of vocational school, teachers have always been passionate teaching us about building drawing technique, including calculating planning budget and computer-aided drafting.
In the last term of school, teachers allowed me to did internship at the biggest cement company.
The asthonised and diversity experiences that I receive with my peers had became a motivation for me to continue study instead immediately working with the expertise I had had a while years ago.

In contonuing post secondary school, I felt the time was so short. However, it had broaden my percepective on architecture field.
The first time I entered college,

It was compulsory in every meeting to finish the drawing and mass study assignment that was unconscionable.
I was required to finish the drawing and mass study assignment that was unconscionable in each meeting.


These assignment, in fact, has grown a good work ethic and hard work on me.
Besides all the labour, the lecture sometimes conducted a study trip or just an usual presentation that intrigue me with a digest of architecutre knowledge from all over the world.
For instance, once, they gave a presentation about historic river named Cheongyecheon.
This river has been undergone many transformation that address quite much issue of the city.
Until it has became an atractive recreational area which undoubtly been proud of seoul.

Architecture has been a major influence in my life. It is quite around a decade now. It started when I was in vocational high school and continued in master's degree.
What has become a great impact was when I had learnt how architecture from around the world shape the life of today society.
When I was in undergraduate, we often explore world architecture, like from turkiye, europe and even asian countries such as korea.
This had became a reflection to my country. For example,

After I graduated a master of architecture from one of the top ten Indonesia's University with cumlaude predicate, I came back to my hometown which is quite far away from my university.
After graduated in master of archtecture at Diponegoro university with cumlaude predicate, I came back to my hometown.
While I was on my way home, I passed by my vocational high school where I studied building technique.
In this school, I was practicing extensive building drawing.
In this school, I began to learn drawing
In this school, I had experienced working together on drawing assignment with my peers.
Beside that, I had also did an internship in the biggest cement company in the south sulawesi. All of these knowledge and experiences were the beginning from my journey to architecture field which I have always been passionate about.

Not long after a high school farewell trip, I continued to study architecture in undergraduate's program at University Technology of Yogyakarta.

I have gained more experience here than my school before. The university has opened my mind to the broader architecture world.
First, it has taught me a numerous theory and study case of architecture.
For example, lecturer has often explained the impressive architecture from different country such as turkiye, korea, and other countries.
Second, it also has given me a chance to deal with real problems that an environment has been facing. For instance, each semester, the project assignment has let us to find the solution for building's issues in certain places. Not only for the building but also the solution for the impact of environment from building.




The knowledge and experience becoming a student of building drawing class in those days had intrigued me to become an architecture.

The wonderful gaining knowledge and experience of building drawing and even construction involvment have
